# Suppose you got detention 
# and the teacher wants you to write "I will not use Snapchat in class" on the whiteboard 100 times.
# Create a detention.py program that does this using code.

# This is where we begin to see the true power of computing. 
# What takes humans hours can take a computer microseconds.

for i in range(100):
    print("I will not use Snapchat in class.")
# The for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly.
# The range function generates a sequence of numbers, which is used to control the number of iterations.
